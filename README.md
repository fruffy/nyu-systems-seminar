This term the seminar takes place every Wednesday from **12:30AM to 1:30PM**. The meeting takes place in person.

## Topics
The seminar discusses a broad range of recent systems papers. Papers are selected from typical systems related conferences, including, but not limited to, the following:

General Systems: [OSDI](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/osdi), [SOSP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sosp), [NSDI](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/nsdi/), [ATC](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/usenix), [EuroSys](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/eurosys/)

Security: [USENIX Security](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/uss/), [CCS](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ccs/), [Oakland](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sp/), [NDSS](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ndss/)

Networking: [SIGCOMM](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sigcomm/), [INFOCOM](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/infocom/), [IMC](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/imc/)

Architecture: [ASPLOS](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asplos/), [ISCA](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/isca/), [MICRO](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/micro/)

Distributed Systems: [PODC](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/podc/), [ICDCS]( https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icdcs/)

Storage: [FAST](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/fast/)

Some academic terms may have a specfic theme. All the chosen papers are related to that theme.

## Schedule

Each reading group presenter should:
- Send an email reminder to the nyu-systems-reading-group@nyu.edu with paper details and update the URL in the repository a few days prior to the group meeting (at least two days before).

### Spring 2023 (Cloud Scale Databases)

Design and implementation of cloud scale database has an impact on how many of us build and optimize our systems: for those working in the lower-layers (e.g., on offloads, etc.) this is a common application that might influence designs; for those working on tracing, these systems are often what is used to store and query things, and has an impact on what is stored and why; and in general many of these have intricate algorithms (since they are inherently distributed). Reasoning about what properties they provide, and why, is a fun puzzle.
